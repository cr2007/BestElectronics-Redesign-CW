    <h3>Our History</h3>
    <p>A little background into why Best Electronics was started 36 years ago and a short list of Best Exclusive made
      Atari Products, Atari Upgrade kits, Replacement and Upgraded Atari parts Best has developed / produced in the
      last 36 years in the Atari business.
    </p>
    <p>Best Electronics bought thousands and thousands of pallets of Atari goods out of the local Sunnyvale Atari
      warehouses, in theory we could run our Atari company for 15 to 30+ years on what we
      bought from Atari!
    </p>
    <p>We strongly believe in Atari Customer Service / Support and helping our
      Atari customers with there Atari product problems. We are always trying to do improvements on existing Atari
      products and bring in new Atari goods and upgraded Atari replacement parts for Atari users when we can.
    </p>
    <p>Over the last 35+ years
      in the Atari business, Best Electronics has invested close to $98,000+ in Engineering Development costs, New
      tooling costs including New plastic molds, Silk Screens, test fixtures and nmuch more.
      For a small Atari company like Best, in a lot of cases it was a leap of faith and a
      long time investment in the Atari market place to invest that amount of company funds in new Atari replacement parts.
